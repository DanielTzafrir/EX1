Weighted Graph:
in this project you can build a undirectional weighted graph and do some alogrithems on it.

I used Collection of nodes to represent the neighbors of a node, and I used HashMap to represent the edges that are connecting to this node by the Edge number and the weight of the edge.

For the graph i used a HashMap with Integer as a key and a node as a value.

The optional algorithems:
1. init 
2. getGraph
3. copy
4. isConnected
5. shortestPathDist
6. shortestPath
7. save (as a file)
8. load (from a file)
